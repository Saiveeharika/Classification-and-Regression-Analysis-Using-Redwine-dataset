# Classification-and-Regression-Analysis-Using-winequality-dataset
This project aims to predict the quality of red wine based on its chemical properties using various machine learning techniques, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks. The dataset contains 11 features, such as alcohol content, volatile acidity, citric acid, and residual sugar, with the target being the quality of the wine, ranging from 0 to 7. Key features include pH levels, sulphates, density, and free sulfur dioxide.
To set up the project, install dependencies which includes `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`, and `keras`. Data preprocessing involves handling missing values, encoding the target variable, and scaling features.
After preprocessing, models can be trained and evaluated, with performance assessed using Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared score, and loss values for neural networks.
The models used include a simple Linear Regression model, Decision Trees, an ensemble Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and a Neural Network for deeper relationships. 
Results from each model will be compared to determine which provides the best prediction accuracy. This project demonstrates the use of both traditional machine learning methods and more complex deep learning techniques for wine quality prediction. The ultimate goal is to build a robust system that predicts wine quality based on chemical composition, which can be useful for winemakers and wine enthusiasts alike.
